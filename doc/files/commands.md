# Custom commands: 

The file [commands.lua](../lua/commands.lua "Link for file") contains the custom commands added for me 
and this file contains the description of all commands 

if you want create more custom commands i recommend you place the your command on 
[../lua/commands.lua](commands "Link for file") file

## Telescope:

- TeleSearch

This command is so long and im shortened for use it more fast <br>
And this command is very util for search words on open file 

- TeleSearchAll

Search words in multiple files on your directory but for use this command 
you need download ripgrep on your computer if you stay on linux distro or WSL 
download with your default external repository like the apt or dnf etc.
